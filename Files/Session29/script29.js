/*What Can You Build With Node.js?
Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking model.

It can handle many connections at once without waiting for one to finish before starting another.

This makes it great for real-time apps and high-traffic websites.

Here are some examples of what you can build with Node.js:

Web servers and websites
REST APIs
Real-time apps (like chat)
Command-line tools
Working with files and databases
IoT and hardware control*/


console.log("hello node!");

const num = 1;
const num2 = 2;
const sum = num + num2;
console.log(sum);
